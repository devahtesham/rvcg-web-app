          <h6>Referral Commission Standards in the Real Estate Industry</h6>
          <p className='mb-3'>
            We are committed to transparency, fairness, and integrity in all aspects of our business, including our referral commission structure. When establishing our commission rates, we carefully consider industry standards and best practices to ensure that our referral program provides value to both referrers and clients. Here’s how we approach setting our referral commission standards:
          </p>
        </div>
        <section className="points mt-3">
          <p className='mb-3'>
            <p className='fw-bold d-inline'>1. Industry Standards:</p> We conduct thorough research to understand what other companies in the real estate industry are offering for referral commissions. This allows us to gain insight into common practices and benchmark our commission structure accordingly.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-3'>
            <p className='fw-bold d-inline'>2. Value of the Referral:</p> We recognize the significant impact that a successful referral can have on our business. We consider the lifetime value of a referred client, taking into account factors such as potential repeat business and long-term relationships. If a successful referral leads to ongoing or repeat business that generates significant revenue, we may offer a higher commission percentage to reflect the value of the referral.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-3'>
            <p className='fw-bold d-inline'>3. Cost of Acquisition:</p> We carefully evaluate the cost of acquiring a new client through various marketing channels, comparing it to the cost of paying referral commissions. If paying a certain commission percentage results in a lower cost per acquisition compared to other marketing efforts, we consider it a fair deal for all parties involved
          </p>
          <p className='mb-3'>
            <p className='fw-bold d-inline'>4. Competitiveness:</p> We assess the competitiveness of our commission structure to ensure that it incentivizes individuals to make referrals. If the commission percentage is too low compared to competitors, it may not be attractive enough to encourage active participation in our referral program. We strive to offer competitive commission rates that motivate referrers to actively promote our services.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-3'>
            <p className='fw-bold d-inline'>5. Transparency and Trust:</p> We believe in fostering transparency and trust in our referral program. We ensure that our commission structure is clearly communicated to referrers and clients, providing full transparency regarding how commissions are calculated and paid. Transparency builds trust and encourages participation in our referral program, strengthening our relationships with clients and partners.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-3'>
            <p className='fw-bold d-inline'>Disclaimer:</p> While we make every effort to ensure the fairness and accuracy of our referral commission structure, Realty Vision Capital Group reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the referral program at any time without prior notice. This statement is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. By participating in our referral program, you agree to abide by the terms and conditions outlined by Realty Vision Capital Group
